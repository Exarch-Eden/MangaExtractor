# Production build and setup instructions
Production build generation and setup instructions for `Windows-based` computers.

<b><span style="color: red;">Warning</span>: Your node modules must be up to date. Do this by executing command: `npm install`</b>

1. Open command terminal in root directory
2. Execute command:
   <br>
   `npm run build`
   <br>
   This may take a few minutes
3. Navigate to the <b>dist</b> folder generated by the previous command then navigate to the <b>win-unpacked</b>
4. Inside <b>win-unpacked</b> folder, run the executable, <b>GoodsExtractor.exe</b>
   <br>
   <br>
   If prompted to give network access to the application, do so. This is a one-time prompt and is needed for the local server to function properly.
   <br>
   <br>
   At this point, the Electron desktop application should be running.


This concludes the production build and setup instructions.

# Other commands
Custom node commands with several different functionalities to facilitate development.

## React-related commands
- `npm run react-start`
  - Starts up a local server for the React app on port 3000
- `npm run react-build`
  - Generates a production build for the React app which can be found in the <b>build</b> folder
## Electron-related commands
- `npm run electron-start`
  - Starts up the electron app for easy access during development (depends on the command `npm run react-build` for changes to be seen live)
- `npm run electron-build`
  - Generates a production build for the Electron desktop app which can be found in the <b>dist</b> folder
- `npm run electron-dev`
  - Executes both `npm run react-build` and `npm run electron-start` to start up the electron app for development with just one command
## General commands
- `npm run build`
  - Makes use of the commands `npm run react-build` and `npm run electron-build` to generate an up-to-date build folder for the React component and the Electron desktop app for it
- `npm run start`
  - Similar to `npm run react-start` but also concurrently runs the electron app
  - <span style="color: red;"><b>Warning</b></span>: This command is bugged and does not execute the electron app for development as intended. Do not use.
